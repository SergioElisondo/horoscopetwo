		</h2>

		<h2 id="fortune4" class="hidden" class="theForturneMessage">ARIES - Today is a great day to check off all the items on that list of yours, Aries. Get it done.

		</h2>

		<h2 id="fortune12" class="hidden" class="theForturneMessage">SAGGITARIUS - Terrific energy flows your way today, Sagittarius. Make sure that what you're dealing with is genuine.
